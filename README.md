# store-app
A store app.

# Setup



# Install List:
#### Using Sheets
- These two must be installed to use sheets (also, the token.pickle in the directory is used):

This one has a pip name discrepancy, so the module it says it needs is different from what it actually needs:
- pip3 install google-api-python-client
- pip3 install google_auth_oauthlib

#### MySQL

On Windows, you will need to download and install MySQL (and configure a server, using weak legacy authentication) and MySQL workbench. Start a root connection to your MySQL server with the workbench. Next, install mysql-connector:
- pip3 install mysql-connector

I haven't figured it out for Raspbian yet.
